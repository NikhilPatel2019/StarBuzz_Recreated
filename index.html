            coffees and teas. Sure, we want you to have a great cup of coffee and a great coffee experience

            quality Starbuzz coffee that you know will meet your caffeine standards.
      </p>
      <p>And, did we mention caffeine? We've just started funding the guys doing all the wonderful
            research at the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine#section1" target="_blank" title="Read all about caffine">Caffeine Buzz</a>. If you want the latest on coffee and other caffeine
            products, stop by and pay them a visit.

      <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
      <p>"A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted in a damn
              good cup of coffee. Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his plan: a Starbuzz on
              every corner.</p>
      <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.
            And, of course, the big news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to
            create Starbuzz's Web presence, which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs
            of a whole new set of customers.</p>
